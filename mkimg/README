1. These scripts won't build any source, so please ensure your device and kernel are ready.

2. Before running these scripts, please ensure the Android environment was setup.

3. The scripts:

mkboot.sh	: create boot.img

	It will auto find the rootfs in Android output folder and kernel image in arm folder to
	generate boot image.

	Copying rootfs and kernel image to script folder is accepted.

mksystem.sh	: create system.img and userdata.img

	It will auto find the system and data directories in Android output folder to generate
	the two images.

	Copying system and data directories to script folder is accepted.

mkfastboot.sh	: create recovery.img with fastboot

	Normally this script is no more necessary because fastboot was moved to bootloader.

fastboot.sh	: create boot.img and then flash/download it

	Create boot.img and, if with -f option, flash it to the device boot partition; if without
	any option, just download it to device and reboot.
